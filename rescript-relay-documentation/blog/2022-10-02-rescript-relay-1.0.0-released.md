The time has finally come - RescriptRelay `1.0.0` is released! 1.0.0 is a culmination of a long period of work, and carries a large amount of improvements and new features.

All changes (including the breaking ones) can be seen in the [changelog](https://github.com/zth/rescript-relay/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100).

Development is as active as ever, and RescriptRelay itself is used in a growing number of production code bases. It's feels great to be able to finally put `1.0.0` out there, and start a new chapter in RescriptRelay's journey.

## Installing it

```
yarn add rescript-relay@latest
```

Make sure you check out the [changelog](https://github.com/zth/rescript-relay/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100) for breaking changes as you upgrade.

## What comes next?

While there's always work to do and improvements to make, RescriptRelay is in a good state feature wise. The thing missing isn't necessarily features. It's teaching you how to _use all of this_ in the best possible way.

Therefore, we're going to enter a phase for RescriptRelay where we'll focus as much as possible on teaching the ins and outs of building UI with RescriptRelay. This will include things like:

- Much extended and more in depth docs
- Concrete copy-pasteable recipes for how to do just about anything you might need to do when building UI
- Testimonials and case studies from the companies that are already using RescriptRelay in production

We'll also focus on how we can explain the value proposition for RescriptRelay better. Both ReScript and Relay is quite a large buy in, and we need to do a better job explaining why that buy in might be worth it for your company.

Therefore, documentation, examples, recipes and testimonials are the most important things going forward, both for our existing users, as well as new users. Evaluating if RescriptRelay is a good fit for your particular use case should be accessible and easy. Not necessarily easy to make the decision, but easy to find all the information you need.

## Thank you all users!

Lastly I'd like to thank everyone who's supporting me in various ways throughout the years. Everything from testing, contributing actual code, to just cheering on as RescriptRelay makes progress - you're a huge part of why I still think it's fantastically fun to maintain and continue develop RescriptRelay.

I hope you enjoy `1.0.0`!
