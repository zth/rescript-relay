We're actively iterating on an experimental concurrent mode and suspense ready router designed for RescriptRelay, that enables you to do render-as-you-fetch. This lets you start loading both code and data for route in parallell, and as soon as possible, removing request waterfalls and ensuring routing is as fast and efficient as ever.

It's not yet publically released, but you can try it out and read about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rescript-relay-router).
