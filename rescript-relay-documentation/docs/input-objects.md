## Input objects in RescriptRelay

All input objects in your schema will have their types (and maker functions) emitted into the generated file `RelaySchemaAssets_graphql.res`. This means you'll have access to the type definition of all of your input objects regardless of what you're doing. Handy if you're for example making general functions to produce various input objects.
