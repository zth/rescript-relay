# ReasonRelay example

This is an example of how most concepts in ReasonRelay work. You can run it by doing the following:

### Run server

The examples use `graphql-client-example-server`, install and run like this:

```
npm install -g graphql-client-example-server && graphql-client-example-server
```

You will now have a GraphQL server running at https://localhost:4000.

### Run client

`yarn && yarn start` will install all dependencies and start ReScript, Webpack and the Relay compiler. The app will now be available at https://localhost:9000.
